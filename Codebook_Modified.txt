Feature Selection 
=================
The output is a piped delimited data set with the following fields:

"Activity Name" 
"Subject ID" 
"Metric Name" 
"Avg. Metric Value"



Descriptions: 

"Activity Name": A description of the activity being performed. Can be one of the following:

WALKING

WALKING_UPSTAIRS

WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

SITTING

STANDING

LAYING



"Subject ID": An identifier for each participant.


"Metric Name": 

The description of the metric summarized in the field "Avg. Metric Value". 
It is either the Standard deviation or Mean value for the metric in the "Avg. Metric Value" field
Metrics are defined by the naming convention listed below:
	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation


tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

"Avg. Metric Value": An average measurement of any of the above metrics for a specific participant doing a specific activity.
can either be the average or standard deviation	of the field listed above.	



Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
